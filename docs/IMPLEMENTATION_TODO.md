**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28
**Next Review**: Before LLM Content Generation implementation

*This document reflects the current state of the NLJ Platform as of July 2025. The platform has achieved production readiness for core learning delivery functionality.*

## **üöÄ Next Major Initiative: LLM Content Generation Enhancement**

The current LLM Prompt Generator provides a solid foundation, but the next major enhancement will integrate OpenWebUI + LangChain for in-app content generation with RAG capabilities. See `LLM_CONTENT_GENERATION_TODO.md` for detailed planning.

**Priority Order for Remaining Core Features:**
1. **Content Status Management** (improve Draft vs Published workflow, bulk operations)
2. **Review Interface Enhancements** (Play/View preview modes for content review)
3. **Content Versioning UI** (version comparison, rollback, history viewer)
4. **SCORM Export** (LMS integration capability)
5. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** (charts, visualizations, reporting)
6. **LLM Content Generation Integration** (OpenWebUI + LangChain + RAG)
