3. **SCORM Research** - begin requirements gathering while other work progresses

### **For LLM Integration Planning**
1. **Study OpenWebUI** - understand integration patterns before development
2. **Cost Planning** - establish budget and usage monitoring before launch
3. **User Testing** - plan pilot program with existing content creators

### **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Incremental Deployment** - roll out features to small user groups first
2. **Rollback Capability** - ensure all changes can be reversed if needed
3. **Performance Monitoring** - establish baselines before AI integration
