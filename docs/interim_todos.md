REVIEWS:

* Update Review Queue to have actual data?
* Add due dates to reviews.
* Add some workflow templates for reviews.

* Concatenate text and content into just content - no reason to have both.
NOW:

* ✅ We aren't seeing condition information on our links with conditions.
* ✅ Our nodes within the flow editor should show our rendered content, NOT the pre-rendered markdown/html. Those nodes should be closer to a preview than they currently are.    
* ✅ Add "Submit For Review" to the More button, too.
* ✅ Make the More menu smaller.
* ✅ Move cards/table toggle to the same row as the search bar, on the right side.
* ✅ Include search bar + cards/table toggle on the card view.
* ✅ Fix version lookup, since that's currently happening once for each row
* ✅ Variable selector in Flow Editor wasn't showing all scenario variables (now fixed)
* ✅ Autolayout uses far too much space between nodes, making it hard to actually read / look at. Let's make them closer. 
* Let's add a More button to the card view of our activities, so we can do the same actions we can on table on our card
* In the Flow Editor, our bottom edge is not tied to the bottom of the actual node, but a static distance from the top edge. This makes selection difficult. (Still needs fixing - React Flow measured dimensions issue)
