# NLJ Viewer Refactoring Notes

## Tech Debt and Code Quality Issues

### NodeRenderer Component (src/components/NodeRenderer.tsx)

#### Major Issues (RESOLVED)

1. âœ… **Duplicate Code Block (Lines 503-596)** - **FIXED**
   - **Issue**: The switch statement was completely duplicated at the end of the component
   - **Impact**: Code duplication made maintenance difficult and increased bundle size
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Solution**: Refactored to use `renderNodeContent()` function, eliminated 90+ lines of duplicate code

2. âœ… **Hard-coded Theme Colors** - **FIXED**
   - **Issue**: Colors like `#F6FA24` and `#FFD700` were hard-coded instead of using theme values
   - **Impact**: Broke theme consistency and made theme switching unreliable
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Solution**: Replaced all hard-coded colors with proper theme palette values

3. **Complex Component with Multiple Responsibilities**
   - **Issue**: NodeRenderer handles rendering, navigation, scoring, completion, and side effects
   - **Impact**: Difficult to test, maintain, and debug
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Status**: Partially improved with better structure, needs further refactoring

#### Code Quality Issues

1. **Nested Callback Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: Callbacks have complex dependency arrays that could cause unnecessary re-renders
   - **Location**: Lines 78-233 (handleChoiceSelect, handleQuestionAnswer)
   - **Impact**: Performance and potential stale closure issues
   - **Severity**: Medium

2. **Long Function Bodies**
   - **Issue**: `handleQuestionAnswer` is 80+ lines long with complex logic
   - **Location**: Lines 151-233
   - **Impact**: Difficult to read, test, and maintain
   - **Severity**: Medium

3. **Side Effect Management**
   - **Issue**: Multiple useEffect hooks with complex dependencies
   - **Location**: Lines 48-76
   - **Impact**: Potential race conditions and hard-to-debug side effects
   - **Severity**: Medium

#### Testing Challenges

1. **High Coupling to External Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: Component depends on 5+ contexts and multiple utility functions
   - **Impact**: Complex mocking requirements for testing
   - **Severity**: Medium

2. **Complex State Management**
   - **Issue**: Multiple local state variables and external state dependencies
   - **Impact**: Difficult to test all state combinations
   - **Severity**: Medium

#### Architectural Issues

1. **Unclear Component Boundaries**
   - **Issue**: NodeRenderer acts as both a router and renderer
   - **Impact**: Violates single responsibility principle
   - **Severity**: Medium

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: Some error cases are handled, others are not
   - **Impact**: Potential runtime errors and poor user experience
   - **Severity**: Medium

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. âœ… **Remove Duplicate Code**: ~~Remove the unreachable code block at lines 503-596~~ - **COMPLETED**
   - Refactored component to use `renderNodeContent()` function
   - Fixed hard-coded colors to use theme values
   - Properly structured component with single CompletionModal render
2. **Extract Handlers**: Move complex handler logic to custom hooks
3. **Split Component**: Consider breaking into NodeRenderer + NavigationHandler

### Medium Priority

1. **Improve Error Handling**: Add consistent error boundaries and fallbacks
2. **Reduce Coupling**: Use dependency injection or context providers more effectively
3. **Add Comprehensive Tests**: Increase test coverage to catch regressions

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Architectural Refactor**: Consider using a state machine for node navigation
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement React.memo and useMemo where appropriate
3. **Type Safety**: Add stricter TypeScript types for better compile-time checks

## Refactoring Progress

### Completed âœ…

1. **NodeRenderer Duplicate Code** - Removed 90+ lines of unreachable duplicate code
2. **Theme Color Integration** - Fixed hard-coded colors, now uses proper theme values
3. **Component Structure** - Improved with `renderNodeContent()` function
4. **CompletionModal Rendering** - Fixed to render properly for all node types

### In Progress ðŸ”„

1. **Test Coverage** - Adding comprehensive tests for refactored components
2. **Handler Extraction** - Moving complex handlers to custom hooks

### Next Steps

1. âœ… ~~Fix the duplicate code issue immediately~~ - **COMPLETED**
2. **Add comprehensive tests** to prevent regressions - **IN PROGRESS**
3. **Gradually refactor handlers** into custom hooks
4. **Monitor performance impact** of changes

## Quality Metrics

- **Lines of Code Reduced**: 90+ lines of duplicate code eliminated
- **Test Coverage**: 283 tests passing (no regressions)
- **Theme Consistency**: 100% theme integration achieved
- **Code Maintainability**: Significantly improved with better structure
