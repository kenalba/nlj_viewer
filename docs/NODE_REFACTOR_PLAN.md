# Node-Level Refactoring & Knowledge Graph Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the NLJ platform from activity-centric to node-centric learning architecture by extracting nodes from JSON blobs into first-class database entities. This enables cross-activity intelligence, content reusability, granular analytics, and adaptive learning paths while maintaining backward compatibility and zero additional complexity for content creators.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Individual node analytics** with success rates, timing patterns, and optimization insights
- **Content reusability** across multiple activities with performance tracking
- **Smart recommendations** based on learning objectives and keyword relationships  
- **Adaptive learning paths** driven by concept mastery and prerequisite relationships
- **Content optimization** through A/B testing and performance-driven improvements

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture Strengths
- **Robust Content Generation**: `ContentGenerationPage.tsx` already captures keywords and learning objectives
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: xAPI tracking with FastStream event processing and Elasticsearch storage
- **Rich Node Types**: 18+ specialized node components with full TypeScript definitions
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, RedPanda, Docker deployment with 139+ sample activities

### Current Limitations
```javascript
// Problem: Nodes trapped in JSON blobs
ContentItem {
  nlj_data: {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "node-1", "type": "true_false", "text": "Brake systems..." },
      { "id": "node-2", "type": "multiple_choice", "text": "Sales objection..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Constraints:**
- No cross-activity node reuse or optimization
- No individual node performance tracking
- No concept-based learning progression  
- No content intelligence or smart suggestions
- Keywords/objectives exist but aren't connected to individual nodes

## Target Architecture: Hybrid PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch

### **Design Philosophy**
**xAPI-First Analytics:** xAPI statements serve as the primary data input, driving updates to both PostgreSQL (learning graph structure) and Elasticsearch (performance analytics).

**Hybrid Data Storage Strategy:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Learning graph structure, relationships, content management
- **Elasticsearch**: xAPI statements, performance analytics, search and recommendations
- **Event-Driven Updates**: FastStream consumers maintain consistency between both stores

### **Data Flow Architecture**
```
User Interaction → xAPI Statement → RedPanda → FastStream Consumers:
                                                 ├─ Elasticsearch (statements + analytics)
                                                 └─ PostgreSQL (node metrics + relationships)
```

**Why Hybrid Architecture:**
- ✅ **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: No new databases, proven PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch expertise
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Strengths**: Complex relationships, ACID transactions, content management workflows
- ✅ **Elasticsearch Strengths**: xAPI analytics, search, time-series performance data
- ✅ **Evolutionary Path**: Can add Neo4j for advanced graph algorithms later if needed
- ✅ **Start Simple**: Basic indexes and queries, add optimization layers as requirements grow

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hybrid Architecture Implementation

**Query Pattern Examples:**
```python
class LearningAnalyticsService:
    async def get_node_performance(self, node_id: str):
        # Get node metadata from PostgreSQL
        node = await NodeService.get_node(node_id)
        
        # Get performance analytics from Elasticsearch  
        performance = await ESService.aggregate_node_performance(node_id)
        
        return NodePerformanceReport(node=node, analytics=performance)
        
    async def get_learning_recommendations(self, user_id: str):
        # Get user's concept mastery from PostgreSQL
        mastery = await ConceptMasteryService.get_user_mastery(user_id)
        
        # Get performance-ranked content from Elasticsearch
        candidates = await ESService.search_high_performing_nodes(
            concepts=mastery.weak_concepts
        )
        
        return RecommendationEngine.rank_suggestions(candidates, mastery)
```

**Event-Driven Updates:**
```python
# Enhanced xAPI processing for hybrid storage
@broker.subscriber("xapi-statements")
async def process_node_interaction(statement: XAPIStatement):
    node_id = extract_node_id_from_statement(statement)
    
    # Store raw statement in Elasticsearch (existing)
    await es_service.index_statement(statement)
    
    # Extract and aggregate performance data for PostgreSQL
    performance_data = NodePerformanceExtractor.extract(statement)
    await node_service.update_performance_metrics(node_id, performance_data)
    
    # Update user concept mastery in PostgreSQL
    concepts = await node_service.get_node_concepts(node_id)
    await mastery_service.update_user_mastery(user_id, concepts, performance_data)
```

### Migration Strategy

**Backward Compatibility Approach:**
```python
# Support both access patterns during transition
class ContentItemService:
    def get_activity_nodes(self, activity_id: str):
        # Try new node-first approach
        nodes = NodeService.get_nodes_by_activity(activity_id)
        if nodes:
            return nodes
            
        # Fallback to legacy JSON blob  
        content_item = ContentItem.query.get(activity_id)
        return extract_nodes_from_nlj_data(content_item.nlj_data)
```

**Zero-Downtime Deployment:**
- Feature flags for progressive rollout
- Dual-write pattern during migration  
- Rollback procedures with data integrity validation
- Performance monitoring and alerting

### Performance Considerations

**Simple Database Optimization:**
```sql
-- Essential indexes for PostgreSQL
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_node_interactions_node_created 
ON node_interactions(node_id, created_at);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_node_keywords_lookup
ON node_keywords(keyword_id, relevance_score DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_objective_prerequisites
ON objective_prerequisites(objective_id, relationship_strength DESC);
```

**Elasticsearch Aggregation Strategy:**
- Daily aggregation jobs for node performance metrics
- Real-time dashboards using Elasticsearch aggregations
- Time-series analysis for learning pattern detection

### Integration Points

**Content Studio Enhancement:**
