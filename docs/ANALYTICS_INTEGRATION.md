      "password": "nlj-secure-secret-2024",
      "scopes": ["statements/write", "statements/read", "activities/read"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîÑ Event Processing Pipeline

### xAPI Event Flow
1. Frontend generates xAPI events from user interactions
2. Events are published to Kafka topics
3. Kafka Ralph Consumer processes events
4. Events are validated and transformed to xAPI 1.0.3 format
5. Ralph LRS stores events in Elasticsearch
6. Analytics API queries Elasticsearch for dashboard data

### Supported Event Types

- **Training Programs**: program.created, program.published
- **Training Sessions**: session.scheduled, session.cancelled
- **Bookings**: booking.requested, booking.confirmed, booking.waitlisted
- **Attendance**: attendance.checked_in, attendance.completed
- **Certificates**: certificate.earned
- **Activity Events**: All frontend learning activity interactions

## üõ† Development

### Backend Services

Key files:
- `backend/app/services/ralph_lrs_service.py` - Ralph LRS integration
- `backend/app/services/elasticsearch_service.py` - Direct Elasticsearch queries
- `backend/app/services/kafka_ralph_consumer.py` - Event pipeline consumer
- `backend/app/api/analytics.py` - Analytics API endpoints

### Frontend Components

Key files:
- `frontend/components/dashboards/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `frontend/shared/SidebarNavigation.tsx` - Navigation integration (admin only)
- `frontend/App.tsx` - Route handling

### Adding New Analytics

1. **Backend**: Add new endpoints to `backend/app/api/analytics.py`
2. **Elasticsearch**: Extend queries in `elasticsearch_service.py`
3. **Frontend**: Add new dashboard tabs or components
4. **Charts**: Use MUI X Charts for consistency

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Service Health**:
   ```bash
   # Test Ralph LRS
   curl http://localhost:8100/xAPI/about
   
   # Test Elasticsearch
   curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
   ```

2. **Analytics API**:
   ```bash
   # Get platform overview (requires auth token)
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/overview
   ```

3. **Dashboard Access**:
   - Login as admin user
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/app/analytics
   - Verify charts and data display

### Creating Test Data (Future)

A future backlog item will create a fake data generator script to populate the system with meaningful learning analytics data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## üîí Security & Permissions

### Access Control
- Analytics dashboard: **Admin users only**
- Analytics API: **Role-based access** (learners can view own data)
- Ralph LRS: **Basic auth** with scoped permissions
- Elasticsearch: **Internal network only** (no external access)

### Data Privacy
- Personal data is stored in xAPI compliant format
- Learner email addresses are used as identifiers
- Individual analytics require proper authorization

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Elasticsearch Optimization
- Single node configuration for development
- Index mapping optimized for analytics queries
- Configurable chunk sizes for read/write operations

### Caching Strategy
- Ralph LRS includes built-in statement caching
- Frontend implements client-side data caching
- API responses include appropriate cache headers

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Real-time system status in dashboard
- Error handling with graceful degradation

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Analytics Features
- Real-time dashboard updates
- More chart types (Pie charts, Scatter plots)
- Advanced filtering and drill-down capabilities
- Automated report generation

### Data Pipeline
- Stream processing for real-time analytics
- Data retention and archival policies
- Advanced machine learning insights

### Integration
- Integration with external LMS systems
- SCORM compliance tracking
- Advanced learner journey mapping

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ralph LRS Connection Failed**
   - Check if ralph-lrs container is running
   - Verify authentication credentials
   - Check network connectivity between services

2. **Elasticsearch Connection Failed**
   - Ensure elasticsearch container has sufficient memory
   - Check cluster health status
   - Verify index exists and is accessible

3. **Empty Analytics Dashboard**
   - Check if Kafka consumer is processing events
   - Verify xAPI events are being generated
   - Check Elasticsearch for stored statements

4. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure user has admin role for analytics access
   - Check authentication token validity
   - Verify API endpoint permissions

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View service logs
docker-compose logs ralph-lrs
docker-compose logs elasticsearch
docker-compose logs nlj-api

# Check Kafka consumer status
docker-compose logs nlj-api | grep "kafka"

# Monitor Elasticsearch indices
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
```

## üìÑ Standards Compliance

### xAPI 1.0.3 Compliance
- All events follow xAPI statement structure
- Proper actor, verb, object, result, and context formatting
- ADL-certified Ralph LRS ensures standards compliance

### Learning Analytics Standards
- Follows learning analytics best practices
- Supports common learning analytics use cases
- Extensible for custom analytics requirements
