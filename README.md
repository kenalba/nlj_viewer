- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust data persistence with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication and session management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Multi-tier permissions (Player/Creator/Reviewer/Approver/Admin)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Apache Kafka for real-time integration and xAPI event streaming
- **Cal.com Integration**: Self-hosted scheduling system for in-person training sessions
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized deployment with Docker Compose
- **Content API**: Full CRUD operations with filtering, search, and pagination

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Modern Dashboard**: Responsive home page with quick actions, metrics, and review queue
- **Activities Browser**: Card/table view toggle with advanced filtering and search

- **Flow Editor**: WYSIWYG visual editor with React Flow integration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Material-UI components
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light themes with toggle functionality

### **Learning Activities & Games**
- **Complete Question Types**: True/False, Multiple Choice, Ordering, Matching, Short Answer, Likert Scales, Rating Questions, Matrix Questions, Sliders, Text Areas
- **Interactive Games**: Connections word puzzles (NYT-style) and Wordle games
- **Visual Interactions**: Drag-and-drop ordering, visual connection lines for matching
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for accessibility
- **Audio Feedback**: User-controlled sound system with oscillator-based audio
- **xAPI Integration**: Comprehensive event tracking with learning analytics

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform is built with modern web technologies and event-driven architecture:

- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React + Material-UI + Vite
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL
- **Event System**: Apache Kafka (KRaft mode) for real-time integration
- **Scheduling**: Self-hosted Cal.com for in-person training management
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (326 tests passing)

## üîß Development

### Frontend Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run test -- --run # Run test suite (326 tests passing)
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
docker-compose up               # Start all services (NLJ + Cal.com + Kafka)
docker-compose up nlj-api       # Start just NLJ backend for development
docker-compose down             # Stop all services
docker-compose logs cal-com     # View Cal.com logs
```

### Backend Commands
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # Development server
python -m pytest                # Run tests
```

### Pre-deployment Verification
```bash
./scripts/pre-deploy.sh  # Verify build, tests, and deployment readiness
```
