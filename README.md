### Type System
```typescript
interface NLJScenario {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  nodes: NLJNode[];
  links: Link[];
  variableDefinitions?: VariableDefinition[];
}

interface NLJNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'start' | 'question' | 'choice' | 'interstitial_panel' | 'end' | 
        'true_false' | 'ordering' | 'matching' | 'short_answer';
  text: string;
  media?: Media;
  // ... additional properties based on question type
}
```

### State Management
- **React Context + useReducer** pattern for predictable state updates
- **localStorage** persistence for scenario data
- **Real-time debugging** with development mode logging

## 🎨 Theming

The application uses a custom Material UI theme with:
- **Primary**: Black (#1A1A1A) for main interface elements
- **Secondary**: Silver (#C0C0C0) for accents and borders
- **Accent**: Blue (#0078D4) for interactive elements and progress
- **Typography**: Roboto font family with consistent hierarchy
- **Components**: Custom styling for buttons, cards, and form elements

## 🔧 Development

### Build Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Production build (TypeScript errors resolved)
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run test         # Run test suite (203 tests passing)
npm run test:ui      # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint         # Run ESLint (39 non-critical issues remaining)
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript compiler check
```

### Pre-deployment Verification
```bash
./scripts/pre-deploy.sh  # Comprehensive deployment readiness check
```

The pre-deployment script verifies:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation success
- ✅ All tests passing (203/203)
- ✅ Critical lint issues resolved
- ✅ Build process completion
- ⚠️ Reports non-critical style warnings

### Debug Mode
Development mode automatically enables comprehensive console logging:

```javascript
// Debug mode is auto-enabled in development
// To disable: localStorage.setItem('nlj_debug', 'false')
// To enable in production: localStorage.setItem('nlj_debug', 'true')

// Available debug commands:
nlj_debug.enable()    // Enable debugging
nlj_debug.disable()   // Disable debugging
nlj_debug.isEnabled() // Check status
```

Debug output includes:
- State changes with before/after comparison
- User interactions (choices, navigation)
- Variable updates and calculations
- Scenario loading and completion events
