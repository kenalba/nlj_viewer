## üîß Development & Build Process

### Understanding the Project Structure

The project uses a **monorepo structure** with separate frontend and backend builds:

```
nlj_viewer/                    # Root directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json              # Root orchestration scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/                 # React + Vite application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json         # Frontend dependencies and build scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/               # Frontend build output
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/                 # FastAPI application
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml      # Python dependencies
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app/               # Backend source code
```

### Build Commands

**From the root directory:**
```bash
npm run build                # Full platform build (schema + frontend)
npm run build:frontend       # Frontend build only
npm run generate:schema      # Generate schema documentation
```

**From the frontend directory:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build               # Vite build ‚Üí dist/ folder
npm run dev                 # Development server
npm run test -- --run      # Run test suite (326 tests passing)
npm run lint                # Run ESLint
```

### üö® Build Troubleshooting

**Issue: `npm run build` fails with working directory errors**
```bash
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Navigate to frontend directory first:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Use absolute paths (WSL environments):**
   ```bash
   cd /full/path/to/nlj_viewer/frontend
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Reset working directory:**
   ```bash
   cd .
   npm run build
   ```

**Issue: TypeScript compilation errors**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Check specific TypeScript errors
```

**Issue: Dependency problems**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Frontend Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run test -- --run # Run test suite (326 tests passing) - ALWAYS use --run flag
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Docker Commands

For containerized development, see **[Docker-README.md](./Docker-README.md)** for comprehensive Docker deployment guide.

```bash
# Development with hot reload
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Legacy commands
docker-compose up               # Start all services
docker-compose up nlj-api       # Start just NLJ backend
docker-compose down             # Stop all services
```

### Backend Commands
```bash
cd backend
uv sync                         # Install dependencies
. .venv/bin/activate           # Activate virtual environment
uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # Development server
python -m pytest               # Run tests
```

### Pre-deployment Verification
```bash
./scripts/pre-deploy.sh  # Comprehensive verification:
                        # ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation
                        # ‚úÖ Test suite (326 tests)
                        # ‚úÖ Critical lint issues
                        # ‚úÖ Build success
```
