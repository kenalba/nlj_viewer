## Architecture

### Core Components

- **GameEngine** (`useGameEngine.ts`): State management for scenario progression
- **NodeRenderer**: Dynamic rendering of all question types and panel nodes
- **ScenarioLoader**: File upload and sample scenario selection with Trivie Excel support
- **GameView**: Main gameplay interface with progress tracking
- **Question Components**: Specialized components for each question type
  - `TrueFalseNode`: Interactive True/False buttons with feedback
  - `OrderingNode`: Drag-and-drop item reordering with validation
  - `MatchingNode`: Click-to-connect matching with visual connection lines
  - `ShortAnswerNode`: Text input with flexible answer validation
  - `UnifiedQuestionNode`: Multiple choice with enhanced choice buttons
  - `LikertScaleNode`: 1-5, 1-7, 1-10+ scales with custom labels
  - `RatingNode`: Star ratings, numeric scales, and categorical ratings
  - `MatrixNode`: Grid-based questions with responsive design
  - `SliderNode`: Continuous scale input with custom ranges
  - `TextAreaNode`: Long-form text input with validation

### Type System

```typescript
interface NLJScenario {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  nodes: NLJNode[];
  links: Link[];
  variableDefinitions?: VariableDefinition[];
}
```

### State Management

React Context + useReducer pattern for:

- Current node tracking
- Variable state management
- Progress calculation
- Scenario completion

## Usage

1. **Load Scenario**: Upload NLJ JSON file, Trivie Excel file, or select sample
2. **Navigate**: Progress through various question types with interactive elements
3. **Receive Feedback**: Immediate validation, scoring, and audio feedback
4. **Track Progress**: Visual completion indicators and scenario completion

## Development

### Build Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run test         # Run test suite (83 tests passing)
npm run test:ui      # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint         # Run ESLint (39 non-critical issues remaining)
```

### Pre-deployment Verification

```bash
./scripts/pre-deploy.sh  # Verify build, tests, and critical lint issues
```

The pre-deployment script automatically checks:
- TypeScript compilation success
- All tests passing
- Critical lint issues (allows non-critical warnings)
- Deployment readiness status

### Testing Content

Sample content available:
- **NLJ Scenarios** (`/static/sample_nljs/`): FSA sales training modules, product knowledge scenarios, interactive decision trees
- **Trivie Quizzes** (`/static/sample_trivie_quiz/`): Excel format quiz exports
- **Survey Templates** (`/static/sample_surveys/`): Automotive and cross-industry employee feedback surveys

## Schema Support

Supports comprehensive activity schema including:

- **Training Question Types**: Multiple Choice, True/False, Ordering, Matching, Short Answer
- **Survey Question Types**: 
  - Likert Scales (1-5, 1-7, 1-10+ scales with custom labels)
  - Rating Questions (stars, numeric, categorical)
  - Matrix Questions (grid-based with responsive design)
  - Sliders (continuous scale input)
  - Text Areas (long-form responses with validation)
- **Interactive Elements**: Drag-and-drop, visual connections, text input, continuous scales
- **Media Integration**: Images, videos, and rich content
- **Variable tracking and conditions**: Dynamic scenario progression
- **Interstitial panels**: Informational content between questions
- **Multiple outcome paths**: Branching narrative support
- **Feedback and scoring**: Immediate validation with audio feedback

  - Manager Effectiveness Survey (360-degree feedback)
  - Work-Life Balance & Well-being Survey

## Current Development Status

âœ… **Core System**: Fully functional with all question types implemented
âœ… **Testing**: 83 tests passing, comprehensive test coverage
âœ… **Deployment**: TypeScript build errors resolved, deployment-ready
âœ… **UI/UX**: Responsive design, keyboard navigation, audio feedback
ðŸš§ **In Progress**: xAPI/TinCan integration for learning record store (LRS) support

## Next: xAPI Integration Implementation

Implementing comprehensive xAPI event emission system as outlined in POST_ACTIVITY.md:

**Phase 1** (Current): Basic xAPI statement generation and results display
- xAPI types and interfaces
- Statement generation utilities  
- Event tracking context provider
- Activity lifecycle event emission
- Question interaction event emission
- Simple post-activity results screen

**Phase 2** (Planned): Advanced analytics and integration
- Detailed performance analytics
- CSV/JSON export capabilities
- PDF report generation
- LRS integration endpoints

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced xAPI Features**: Statement batching, offline storage, custom authentication
- **Offline capability**: Service worker and local storage sync
